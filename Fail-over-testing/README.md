Failover testing using Terraform typically involves simulating a failure in one region or resource and verifying that the system can recover or switch to a secondary region or resource. Here's how you can approach failover testing with Terraform:

### **Step-by-Step Plan for Failover Testing**



### **Automating Failover Testing**

You can write a script to automate the failover testing process. For example:

1. **Simulate Failure**:
   Use Terraform to destroy or disable resources in the primary region:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -target=azurerm_virtual_network.vnet["eastus"]
   ```

2. **Verify Availability**:
   Use a script to check if the application is still accessible in the secondary region:
   ```bash
   curl http://<secondary-region-endpoint>
   ```

3. **Restore Resources**:
   Reapply the Terraform configuration to restore the primary region:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### **Best Practices for Failover Testing**
- **Use a Staging Environment**: Perform failover testing in a non-production environment to avoid disruptions.
- **Automate Testing**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate failover testing regularly.
- **Monitor Metrics**: Use monitoring tools to track application availability and performance during failover.
- **Document Recovery Steps**: Ensure you have clear documentation for restoring resources after testing.
